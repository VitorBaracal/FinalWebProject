Statement of Intent Regarding the Nike Website Clone

My name is Vitor Baraçal Guimarães, and I am a first-semester Software Engineering student at Universidade Positivo. I developed a clone of the Nike website as part of an academic project for the course Basic Web Development.

I want to clarify that this project is intended solely for educational purposes and aims to improve my skills in web interface development. There is no intention to violate Nike's guidelines, infringe upon its copyrights, or use its branding for commercial or profit-driven purposes.

The choice of the Nike website was made due to its visually appealing design and the opportunity to learn from a modern and well-structured example. I emphasize that this project is not intended to harm Nike’s reputation or intellectual property in any way.

Thank you for your understanding, and I reaffirm my commitment to ethical and responsible use of the knowledge gained through this work.
